# Gem CoAP

Ruby Gem for RFC 7252 - Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)<br>
Based on code by Carsten Bormann<br>

The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a specialized web
transfer protocol for use with constrained nodes and constrained
(e.g., low-power, lossy) networks.  The nodes often have 8-bit
microcontrollers with small amounts of ROM and RAM, while constrained
networks such as 6LoWPAN often have high packet error rates and a
typical throughput of 10s of kbit/s.  The protocol is designed for
machine-to-machine (M2M) applications such as smart energy and
building automation.<br>


Implemented Version: RFC (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7252)<br>

Additionally implemented:

 - Blockwise Transfer http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-block-14
 - Observe http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-core-observe-13

## Install
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'coap'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install coap

## Usage

### In your ruby/rails application


    client = CoAP::Client.new
    answer = client.get('coap.me', 5683, '/hello')
    p answer.payload

Lot's of examples are stored in test/test_client.rb<br>
Code is commented in rdoc format
